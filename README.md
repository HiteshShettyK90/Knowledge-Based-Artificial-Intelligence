# Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence
 This repository contains projects on Kownledge Based Artificial Intelligence.
 
 The [rpm-solver-engine](https://github.com/HiteshShettyK90/Knowledge-Based-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/rpm_solver_engine) solves the Ravens Progressive Matrices problems by building a Semantic Network on given realted nodes and then tries to find the solution for the unknown by comparing the Semantic Networks of given to unknown against the solution nodes.
 
 The object and the feature detection are done using [OpenCV library](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/).
